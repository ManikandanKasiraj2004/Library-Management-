Media Class Hierarchy:
	•	Create an abstract Media class with common properties (title, year) and methods (displayDetails).
	•	Create two subclasses, Book and Magazine, which inherit from Media. Each subclass should have additional properties (author for books, issueNumber for magazines).
	2.	Library Class:
	•	Manage a collection of Media objects using a list.
	•	Methods to add, update, remove, display all media, and search by title.
	•	Use sets to avoid duplicate entries based on title and year.
	•	Maintain the stock of each book.
	3.	User Class:
	•	Manage user information (name, library of borrowed books).
	•	Track categories of borrowed books.
	•	Track due dates for borrowed books and calculate penalties if books are returned late.
	4.	User Interaction:
	•	Create a simple text-based menu system to interact with the library (add, update, remove, display, search, issue books, return books).
	•	Librarian can check user penalty amounts.
	5.	Control Flow:
	•	Implement control flow for menu navigation and input validation.
	•	Use loops and conditionals to manage user input and library operations.
	6.	Additional Features:
	•	Ability to save the library state and user data to files and load them on startup.
	•	Implement inheritance and polymorphism where applicable.
